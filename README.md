   - üß∞ *Tip*: Master these tools ‚Äî they‚Äôre essential for network mapping, vulnerability scanning, and information gathering.

---

## üüß **STAGE 3: OFFENSIVE SECURITY ‚Äî Intermediate**  
Learn how to attack and exploit weaknesses.

### 6. **Learn Scanning & Reconnaissance**
   - **Tool**: [Nmap](https://nmap.org/) (Port scanning, OS detection)
   - **Other Tools**: [Nikto](https://cirt.net/Nikto2), [WhatWeb](https://github.com/urbanadventurer/WhatWeb), [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/)
   - üéØ *Tip*: Scanning and reconnaissance are the first steps to identifying attack surfaces and vulnerabilities.

### 7. **Learn Exploitation with Metasploit**
   - **Tool**: [Metasploit Framework](https://www.metasploit.com/)
   - **Practice**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in [Metasploitable](https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/)
   - üí£ *Tip*: Metasploit helps automate attacks and teaches you how vulnerabilities can lead to system access.

### 8. **Web Hacking & OWASP Top 10**
   - **Tool**: [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp) (Intercept and modify web traffic)
   - **Practice**: [DVWA](https://github.com/digininja/DVWA), [bWAPP](http://www.itsecgames.com/), [Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/)
   - **Types of Attacks**: SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, IDOR
   - üåê *Tip*: Web applications are prime targets for hackers, and most vulnerabilities stem from poor input validation.

### 9. **Password Cracking**
   - **Tools**: [John the Ripper](https://www.openwall.com/john/), [Hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/), [Hydra](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra)
